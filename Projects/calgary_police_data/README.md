# Calgary Police Data - Crime & Disorder Statistics Analysis
This project analyzes crime patterns across Calgary communities using open data from the City of Calgary. The analysis includes spatial mapping, time-based trends, and insights into how crime rates vary across weekdays, weekends, and public holidays.

## Project Objective

To explore and visualize crime trends in Calgary using 2024 data. The goal is to uncover actionable insights and demonstrate skills in:

- Data wrangling and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Geographic data visualization using Python
- Working with public datasets
- Drawing insights from temporal trends

## Key Highlights

- **Mapped Calgary communities using GeoJson data and `folium`**
- **Visualized crime counts by community on an interactive choropleth map**
- **Performed temporal analysis** to compare average crimes on:
  - Public holidays
  - Weekends
  - Weekdays
- **Calculated daily average crime rates** for each day type
- **Built visualizations using `matplotlib`** to communicate findings clearly
