## ðŸ’¼ Projects

### ðŸ“Œ Calgary Crime Data Analysis (2024)

A comprehensive analysis of Calgaryâ€™s crime and public disorder data over multiple years using Python, GeoPandas, and interactive GeoJSON mapping. This project integrates community boundaries with monthly crime and disorder counts to visualize spatial and temporal patterns across the city.

- Processed and mapped community boundaries using GeoJSON for precise geospatial visualization
- Created interactive choropleth maps to highlight crime intensity per community in 2024
- Analyzed trends across crime categories and public disorder incidents from 2018 to 2024
- Explored seasonal effects, community-specific crime profiles, and the impact of public holidays
- Identified key hotspots like Beltline and Downtown Commercial Core with higher crime and disorder rates

> Tools: Python, Pandas, json, Folium, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key Insights:
- Crime peaks in summer months and drops in winter, with a notable dip during 2020â€“2022 due to pandemic lockdowns
- Vehicle theft is the most frequent crime type, concentrated in urban neighborhoods
- Communities with higher crime also report more public disorder incidents, indicating correlated social disturbances
